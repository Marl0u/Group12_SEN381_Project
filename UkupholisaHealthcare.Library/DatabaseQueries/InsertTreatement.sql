VALUES('Nitrates','Nitrates are used to widen your blood vessels. Doctors sometimes refer to nitrates as vasodilators.
They Are available in a variety of forms, including tablets, sprays and skin patches such as glyceryl trinitrate and isosorbide mononitrate.
Nitrates work by relaxing your blood vessels, letting more blood pass through them. This lowers your blood pressure and relieves any heart pain you have.
Nitrates can have some mild side effects, including headaches, dizziness and flushed skin.');

INSERT INTO Treatment(TreatmentName,[Description])
VALUES('Calcium channel blockers','Calcium channel blockers also work to decrease blood pressure by relaxing the muscles that make up the walls of your arteries.
This causes the arteries to become wider, reducing your blood pressure.
Examples include amlodipine, verapamil and diltiazem.
Side effects include headaches and facial flushing, but these are mild and usually decrease over time.');

VALUES('Thrombolysis – "clot buster" medicine','Ischaemic strokes can often be treated using injections of a medicine called alteplase, which dissolves blood clots and restores blood flow to the brain.
This use of "clot-busting" medicine is known as thrombolysis.
Alteplase is most effective if started as soon as possible after the stroke occurs – and certainly within 4.5 hours.
Its not generally recommended if more than 4.5 hours have passed, as its not clear how beneficial it is when used after this time.
Before alteplase can be used, its very important that a brain scan is done to confirm a diagnosis of an ischaemic stroke.');

INSERT INTO Treatment(TreatmentName,[Description])
VALUES('Thrombectomy','A small number of severe ischaemic strokes can be treated by an emergency procedure called a thrombectomy.
This removes blood clots and helps restore blood flow to the brain.
Thrombectomy is only effective at treating ischaemic strokes caused by a blood clot in a large artery in the brain. 
Its most effective when started as soon as possible after a stroke.
The procedure involves inserting a catheter into an artery, often in the groin. A small device is passed through the catheter into the artery in the brain.
The blood clot can then be removed using the device, or through suction. The procedure can be done under local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic.');

VALUES('Aspirin ','Most people will be given aspirin straight after having an ischaemic stroke. As well as being a painkiller, aspirin is an antiplatelet, which reduces the chances of another clot forming.
Other antiplatelet medicines may be used later, such as clopidogrel and dipyridamole.');
GO
INSERT INTO Treatment(TreatmentName,[Description])
VALUES('Anticoagulants','Some people may be offered an anticoagulant to help reduce their risk of developing new blood clots in the future.
Anticoagulants prevent blood clots by changing the chemical composition of the blood in a way that prevents clots from forming.
Warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban are examples of anticoagulants for long-term use.
There are also a number of anticoagulants called heparins, which can only be given by injection and are used short term');

Medicines that are commonly used include: thiazide diuretics angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors calcium channel blockers beta blockers alpha-blockers');
GO
INSERT INTO Treatment(TreatmentName,[Description])
VALUES('Carotid endarterectomy','Some ischaemic strokes are caused by narrowing of an artery in the neck called the carotid artery, which carries blood to the brain.
The narrowing, known as carotid stenosis, is caused by a build-up of fatty plaques.
If the carotid stenosis is very severe, surgery may be used to unblock the artery. This is called a carotid endarterectomy.
It involves the surgeon making a cut (incision) in your neck to open up the carotid artery and remove the fatty deposits');
